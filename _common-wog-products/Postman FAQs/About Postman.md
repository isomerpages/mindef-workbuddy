<h1><strong>About Postman</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<h4>Q1: What is Postman V2?</h4>
<p>Postman V2 is a notification service that lets authorised public officers
send one-way SMS messages, to the following target recipients with the
gov.sg Sender ID:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Citizens (i.e., Pre-enlistees, NSFs, NSmen, ROVERS, NS/SAFVC Volunteers,
Members of Public); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixed Groups (i.e., citizens and internal staff)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q2: What is Postman Legacy?</h4>
<p>Postman Legacy refers to the older version of Singapore Government's SMS
messaging system that was used before Postman V2. It has been largely phased
out in favour of Postman V2, which offers enhanced capabilities and security
features. MINDEF/SAF has already migrated to Postman V2 to utilise its
SMS messaging service primarily.</p>
