<h4>Q1: Are vendors allowed to be Campaign Creators?</h4>

clause stated in the AUP on FormSG.</p>

<p><strong>Who can I add as a campaign creator?</strong>
</p>
<p>You will only be able to add officers from your own agency as campaign
creators. This is defined as officers who have the same email domain as
you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vendors <strong>will not</strong> be allowed to have campaign creator access,
as they are not allowed to create campaigns on behalf of agencies. They
can be added to existing campaigns, under campaign settings. Please refer
to <a href="https://postman-v2.guides.gov.sg/postman-v2-admin-portal-for-api-users-mop/campaign-settings#settings-members" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>this page</u></a> for
more information.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>I am aware of and agree to comply with MDDI's policy regarding vendor
access, which stipulates that vendors can only be assigned the Campaign
Collaborator role for sending messages, the Campaign Creator role is exclusively
for MINDEF/SAF Employees, and Campaign Creators are solely responsible
for managing and overseeing Campaign Collaborators.</p>
