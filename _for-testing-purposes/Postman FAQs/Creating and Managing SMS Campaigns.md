<h3><strong>Delivery Tracking and Troubleshooting</strong></h3>
<h4>Q2: How do I monitor the delivery status of each message?</h4>
<p>The status of each message can be seen on the dashboard on the landing
page after login. Refer to the Postman Guides for detailed information
about status tracking and reporting features.</p>
<h4>Q3: What should I do if messages aren't being delivered?</h4>
<p>Check these common issues:</p>
<p>a. Verify recipient contact details are correct</p>
<p>b. Check campaign status in dashboard</p>
<p>c. Verify message content follows guidelines</p>
<p>d. Contact Postman Team if issues persist</p>
<p>Large Campaign Management</p>
<h4>Q4: What are considered large or time-sensitive campaigns?</h4>
<p>Campaigns that fulfil at least one of the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Time-sensitive: If you are making &gt;50 API requests per second, or &gt;100
message segments per second;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large campaigns i.e., above 200,000 recipients</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q5: How will other users’ large campaigns affect my campaign?</h4>
<p>Both your single send and batch send messages may be delayed during periods
of high system load. If you have a non-critical campaign planned, consider
shifting it to a different date/time slot for best deliverability results.</p>
<h4>Q6: Will Campaign Creators be given advance notice of upcoming large campaigns?</h4>
<p>Yes, the Postman Team will strive to inform you two weeks in advance via
email.</p>
