<h1><strong>Usage of gov.sg SMS Sender ID</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>
<h4>Q1: How do I determine if my use case qualifies for gov.sg SMS sender ID?</h4>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<p>• Is the message intended for citizens<sup>1</sup> or mixed groups<sup>2</sup>?</p>
<p>• Does the intended message fall under the ‘critical message’ category
as stipulated in SD Directive 03-2022 Management of MINDEF/SAF’s Direct
Channels of Communication?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes to both questions, gov.sg SMS sender ID may be used.
If the message is purely for internal staff, please use alternative channels.</p>
<p><em><sup>1 </sup>Citizens are defined as Pre-enlistees, NSFs, NSmen, ROVERS, NS/SAFVC Volunteers and members of the public.</em>
</p>
<p><em><sup>2 </sup>Mixed Groups are defined as citizens and internal staff.</em>
</p>
<h3><strong>Mixed Groups [Citizens and Employees] Communications</strong></h3>
<h4>Q2: What if my SMS needs to reach both internal employees and citizens?</h4>
<p>If the communications are targeting a mixed group (both citizens and employees),
the use of the gov.sg SMS sender ID is allowed. The key consideration is
whether citizens are part of the intended audience. Another prerequisite
is that the use case must meet the policy guidelines stipulated in SD Directive
03-2022 Management of MINDEF/SAF’s Direct Channels of Communication.</p>
<h4>Q3: Can you give examples of allowed mixed group scenarios?</h4>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<p>• Public event announcements where both citizens and employees are invited</p>
<p>• Service disruption notifications affecting both citizens and employees</p>
<p>• Emergency alerts relevant to both citizens and employees</p>
<h4>Q4: What if I'm unsure whether my communication qualifies as a mixed group?</h4>
<p>Consult Postman Person-in-Charge (PIC) in Service Delivery Division (SDD)
at <a href="mailto:mindef_postman_pic@defence.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mindef_postman_pic@defence.gov.sg</a> to
verify if your use case meets the criteria for gov.sg SMS sender ID usage.
A FormSG URL will be provided here when it is ready.</p>

<h3><strong>Employee Communications</strong></h3>
<h4>Q5: Can I use Postman V2 with gov.sg SMS sender ID for employee communications?</h4>
<p>A: No. We reserve the gov.sg SMS sender ID for essential messages to citizens
and mixed groups only. For communications to employees, consider using
other channels like email, Telegram or M365.</p>
<h4>Q6: Why can't I use gov.sg SMS sender ID for internal communications?</h4>
<p>MDDI’s guidelines prioritise the gov.sg SMS channel for communicating
essential messages to citizens. We want to avoid citizens ignoring or blocking
the gov.sg SMS channel if they receive non-critical messages.</p>
<h4>Q7: What are the alternatives for employee communications?</h4>
<p>Instead of sending SMS, please consider using:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telegram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft 365 tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MINDEF employee communications (e.g., The Front Page, The Noticeboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push notifications from mobile app</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q8: What if I need to send urgent messages to employees?</h4>
<p>Use MINDEF/SAF's approved emergency communication channels and tools.
These may include internal messaging systems, Telegram groups or other
agency-specific solutions.</p>
<h4>Q9: Are there any exceptions to this policy?</h4>
<p>No. The gov.sg SMS sender ID is strictly for citizens and mixed groups
communications only.</p>
<h4>Q10: Can I use a different SMS sender ID for employee communications?</h4>
<p>A: Please consult SAF C4 &amp; Digitalisation Comd / Cyber Security Taskforce
Directive 04/22 on MINDEF/SAF SMS Sender ID Management dated 9 Jun 22 regarding
the use of alternative SMS sender IDs. Consider using other internal communication
channels instead.</p>
