<h1><strong>Costs and Payment</strong></h1>
<h4>Q1: What is the cost of each SMS message?</h4>
<p>SMS sending via Postman V2 will be chargeable with effect from 1 July
2025. According to the GovTech Finance newsletter (December 2024), the
charge rates are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foreign mobile numbers: $0.23 per segment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local mobile numbers: $0.046 per segment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One SMS message can contain up to 7 segments (the maximum allowed per
transmission). Therefore, the maximum cost per SMS would be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foreign mobile numbers: $1.61 per SMS ($0.23 × 7 segments)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local mobile numbers: $0.322 per SMS ($0.046 × 7 segments)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q2: Are units/organising committees required to seek AOR approval and pay for SMS messages intended for citizens and mixed groups?</h4>
<p>No. DDF has approved the exemption of SMS fees from the AOR process for
messages sent to citizens or mixed groups through Postman. The SMS fees
incurred will be funded by a central MINDEF fund. Refer to MINDEF Finance
Directive 5500-11 Approval of Requirements for more details.</p>
