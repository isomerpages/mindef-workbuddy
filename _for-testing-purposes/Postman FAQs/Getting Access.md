<h3><strong>Account Management</strong></h3>
<h4>Q7: Who can be granted access to Postman V2 to create Campaigns to send SMS?</h4>
<p>Only MINDEF/SAF employees can be granted access to Postman V2 to create
Campaigns via the Campaign Creator role. Vendors, NSFs and NSmen are not
considered MINDEF/SAF employees.</p>
<h4>Q8: How many Campaign Creators can each unit/organising committee nominate?</h4>
<p>Each unit/organising committee can nominate up to two Campaign Creators.</p>
<h4>Q9: Who can be granted access to Postman V2 to assist Campaign Creators in sending SMS?</h4>
<p>Campaign Creators may grant authorised vendors, NSFs and NSmen access
to Postman to assist in sending and monitoring of SMS. They will assume
the role of Campaign Collaborators (members).</p>
<h4>Q10: How many Campaign Collaborators can each unit/organising committee nominate?</h4>
<p>There is no system or policy limit on the number of Campaign Collaborators.
It depends on the needs of each unit/organising committee. Units/organising
committees should consider their operational requirements and ensure effective
oversight of all collaborators.</p>
<h3><strong>Offboarding Process</strong></h3>
<h4>Q11: How do I offboard from Postman V2 after a one-off event?</h4>
<p>SDD will remove the system role from Postman V2 for the respective Campaign
Creators immediately after the one-off event. They will no longer have
access to Postman V2 thereafter.</p>
<h4>Q12: Whom should we notify when Campaign Creators change during an active campaign?</h4>
<p>Submit your request for change of Campaign Creator(s) through <a href="https://form.gov.sg/666904410d69bc2931b3acce" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Request for Postman campaign creator rights</a> to
your superior for approval. After it is approved, SDD will update the Postman
system and inform you accordingly.</p>
